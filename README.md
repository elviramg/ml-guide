# Machine Learning Mathematics and Logic Guide

Welcome to this repository! The objective here is to help people get more into the mathematics and logic behind machine learning (ML), with a strong focus on understanding what's happening behind some of the most popular deep learning models. This guide is designed to be a practical resource for both beginners and intermediate learners who want to deepen their knowledge of ML fundamentals.

By diving into the mathematical concepts and learning how to apply them in code, you'll gain a better understanding of the "why" behind machine learning models, instead of just focusing on the "how." Our purpose is to provide clear explanations and step-by-step examples that demystify the core concepts of machine learning and help you develop strong foundational knowledge.

### Gradient Descent

In this section, we will explore the optimization algorithm used for minimizing the cost function in machine learning models. Gradient Descent is a key component of many machine learning algorithms, especially in neural networks. We will cover:
- What Gradient Descent is
- Types of Gradient Descent (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-batch)
- Mathematical derivation and examples in Python

### Linear Algebra Basics

Understanding linear algebra is critical for working with ML models, as it forms the backbone of many algorithms. Here, we will cover:
- Matrices and their properties
- Eigenvalues and Eigen decomposition
- Common matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.)
- How these concepts apply to machine learning

### Probability

Probability is essential for understanding uncertainty in machine learning. This section will cover:
- Basic probability concepts
- Conditional probability
- Bayes' Theorem
- Random variables and probability distributions
- Application of probability in machine learning algorithms
